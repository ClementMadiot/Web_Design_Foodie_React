# Create React App
Foodie is a Landing Page restaurant using "React"

## Library Used :

### React Icons
At the Mobil breakpoint I use the icon as a link in my sidebar
Also used in my work section

### Script JS
At the section "TESTIOMONALS" I build stunning and responsive slide-based interfaces for showcasing three fake comments. I use the fonctionality 'swiper-pagination' to swap with your finger between comments and the 'swiper-button' for tablet and desktop.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
